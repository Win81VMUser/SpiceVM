Hi! Welcome to Spice Virtual Machines(SpiceVM) 
If you want to make a VM yourself ask owner on discord on our server https://discord.gg/A3rbMehvEB

Rules of SpiceVM:
1. Don't run ransomwares because owner have windows xp on host and don't want to kill his host's
2. Don't run viruses spreading on network because owner have windows xp on host and don't want to kill his host's
3. As anyone can do on these VMs, it may contain NTFS
4. Everything will be logged and you will be banned if neccesary
That's all, have fun on SpiceVM! Links of VM's will be on our discord
