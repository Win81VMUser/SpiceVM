FAQ about SpiceVM:
Q: Why VMs are slow, i can't do anything?
A: VM's are slow because we are hosting on Android phone with 4 gb of ram and 64 disk space.
We are using TCG Acceleration to make it faster :)
Q: VM is trashed and don't boot up, what i can do?
A: Ask owner to load snapshot. If no snapshot, wait until he configure it again(only if hosting on limbo pc emulator)
Q: Why there is only 1 VM at time and why it's Windows, not linux mac, android etc.?
A: We can't host like 2 VMs because owner don't have too much space to keep like win7 and winxp hdd 
and owner don't know how to boot up 2 qemu on termux :(
We are working on make SpiceVM Public Port VNC to connect on website or in 2.0 version Spice Client, but now only anydesk
and emulation is too slow to emulate linux like ubuntu 16.04(don't work ubuntu 4.0 it's too slow) or mac os, Android only in VMOS but Qemu or VMOS, 
Owner don't have a lot of space to host them both
 
That's all, have fun on SpiceVM! Links of VMs will be on our discord
