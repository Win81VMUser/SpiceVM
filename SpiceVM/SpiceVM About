FAQ about SpiceVM:
Q: Why VMs are slow, i can't do anything?

THIS IS IF OWNER'S PC IS TURNED OFF:VM's are slow because we are hosting on Android phone with 4 gb of ram and 64 disk space.
We are using TCG Acceleration to make it faster :)(if owner's pc is turned off)
Q: VM is trashed and don't boot up, what i can do?
A: Ask owner to load snapshot. (Vote-For-Reset is for hard restart vm: system_reset)
Q: Why there is only 1 VM at time and why it's Windows, not linux mac, android etc.?
A: We can't host like 2 VMs cuz we dont have a lot of ram on VM, only 2 gb and 1 cpu. 
There will be more VMs but with low config(like max 512 mb of ram for 2 VMs, 256 for 4 VMs and more)
We will add some linux and android but now MicroXP and KolibriOS :)
 

That's all, have fun on SpiceVM! Links of VMs will be on our discord
